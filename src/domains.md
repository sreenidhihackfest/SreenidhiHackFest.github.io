## Problem Statement Types

For HACKFEST '26, we are introducing two types of problem statements to cater to different strategies and skill levels:

-   **Hard Problem Statement (1)**: These are complex challenges that require a significant effort to build a comprehensive solution. Teams choosing this path will work on a single problem statement over the entire two-day hackathon.
-   **Easy Problem Statements (2)**: These are smaller, more focused challenges. Teams choosing this path must select **two** Easy problem statements. Each will be evaluated at the end of each day.

Each team must choose **one** of the following paths:
-   One (1) Hard Problem Statement
-   Two (2) Easy Problem Statements
