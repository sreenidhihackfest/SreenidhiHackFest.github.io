## Evaluation Tracks & Flow

Evaluation process varies based on the track the team picks:

-   **Hard Problem Track:** Solutions are evaluated at the end of Day 2.
-   **Easy Problem Track:** Teams submit two solutions. The first is evaluated at the end of Day 1, and the second at the end of Day 2.

All projects will be judged on technical merit, innovation, and overall execution.

2.  **Technical Implementation:** Does the solution work effectively?
3.  **Impact & Feasibility:** Does the project address a meaningful problem?
